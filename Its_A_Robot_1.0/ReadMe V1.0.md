So I wrote this to test a bunch of components of the robot with the button pad, because I dont have my controlled Yet
The button pad is super amazing 3 wires, 16 buttons. Im really happy with it so far
cant wait to get the 12 Channel RC Remote
The motor controllers are IBT-2 controllers, they are pretty easy to use Only really require 4 wires. For somereason GND and VCC arent Required??
Not 100% sure, but they work without GND and VCC, even with the arduino and motors on different power sources
I Stole some of the code for driving the motors because I honestly had no idea what I was doing with them 
Thanks to Dr Rainer Hessmer for the motor driving code (and Schematics!) 
Very well documented see it here http://www.hessmer.org/blog/2013/12/28/ibt-2-h-bridge-with-arduino/
I started setting some stuff up to use with the remote but Im not 100% sure how I am going to integrate it so I will get there when it comes in
Thanks to Nick Poole at sparkfun for his tutorial on how to integrate RC controlers and arduinos find it here: www.Sparkfun.com/tutorials/348
I am a coding noob, so I probably did some stuff wrong, but if its wrong and works is it wrong?
the A Modes are for arduinos on i2c which I intended to use for driving the accessories but the more I think about it the more I hate that Idea
I mean do I really need a mega and 2 arduino nanos? Probably not :P SO Ill probably just use the mega outputs
I'll still need the A modes because of how accessories will work (#HotSwap :D)


 Also, Fair warning I really suck at commenting, So, if you don't understand something, message me or file a complaint or something, just do the thing
P.S. I have no clue what I am doing, so, Good Luck :D
